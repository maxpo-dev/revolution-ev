     Malaysia’s electric vehicle (EV) market is gearing up for explosive growth, making it a hotspot in Southeast Asia’s green mobility revolution. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and insights from EY, Malaysia’s EV sector is projected to grow at a 13.2% CAGR between 2025 and 2031, fueled by national incentives, consumer demand, and private sector investments.

               The Malaysian government targets 10,000 public EV charging stations by 2025, directly supporting the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint 2021–2030. This infrastructure boom is expected to ease consumer concerns about range anxiety, a major barrier to EV adoption.

The global electric vehicle market is experiencing unprecedented growth, transforming transportation systems worldwide. According to the IEA’s Global EV Outlook 2024, EVs are expected to represent 20% of total global car sales in 2024, with projections to hit 50% by 2035.
            </p>

            <p>

China leads the world in EV adoption, with nearly 40% of new car sales being electric and exports of 1.2 million EV units in 2023, an 80% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, Deloitte predicts that by 2030, global EV sales will surpass 31 million units annually, led by strong performance in Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.

In the United States, EVs captured 10% of new vehicle sales in 2023, according to U.S. Department of Energy data, though policy shifts may influence growth trajectories moving forward. Europe faces heightened competition from Chinese EV manufacturers, requiring strategic adjustments to maintain its green transition momentum.

            <p>
        The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that this electric shift will reshape global supply chains, impact GDP structures (with Europe's GDP potentially dipping by 0.3%), and redefine employment landscapes across the automotive sector.
